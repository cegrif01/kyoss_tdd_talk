Documentation:

provided that you have an ssh key already setup on github

git clone git@github.com:cegrif01/kyoss_tdd_talk.git

Then run composer install

Keep in mind that you must have composer installed in /usr/local/bin/composer. Sometimes you must run composer.phar install if you installed it by default.  I like to rename my composer file to composer when I download it.

Documentation to download composer can be found on: http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
